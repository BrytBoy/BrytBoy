### Hi there 👋

You found me! 

I'm Bryton Herlong, a DevOps Architect with GitHub. My background's tech-heavy, so I'm happy to help out with all things
- DevOps ⚙️
- InfoSec 🥷🏾
- Cloud ☁️
- Software Engineering 👨🏾‍💻
- Serverless 🧙🏾‍♂️
- Mobile 📱 (iOS please 🙏🏾)
- Baking 🍪

You name it! I also have a great deal of enterprise architecture and business experience, so don't feel there's anything we can't chat about!
