### Hi there 👋

You found me! 

I'm Bryton Herlong, a DevOps Architect with GitHub. My background's tech-heavy, so I'm happy to help out with all things DevOps, InfoSec, Cloud, Software Engineering, Serverless, Mobile (iOS please 🙏🏾), you name it. I also have a great deal of enterprise architecture and business experience, so don't feel there's anything we can't chat about!
